# AI_ML_projects
During my last semester, I took an Engineering course in Machine Learning algorithms (a subtype of AI) taught by Dr. Pedro Garc√≠a. I've compiled different algorithms I wrote as projects for this subject in this repository. Please note that in many cases, these were team projects, and each team member is acknowledged at the beginning of the code file.

Please note the files may have code that's been commented out or even in Spanish, I'll be updating the files into a cleaner version during the following weeks.
